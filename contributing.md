Broadly speaking, we are looking for the following contributions:

* bug-reports
* metric requests (what other things do you want to track for a server)
* fact implmentations
  * a data structure of a fact that can be tracked
  * an (os-agnostic) stdout parser for the ssh command 
  * relevant tests
* suggestions for frontend improvements
* discussions on the open design questions
